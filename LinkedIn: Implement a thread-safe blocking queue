LinkedIn: Implement a thread-safe blocking queue 



http://blog.csdn.net/craiglin1992/article/details/44747863

Question:

public interface BlockingQueue {
    /** Retrieve and remove the head of the queue, waiting if no elements
    are present. */
    T take();
 
    /** Add the given element to the end of the queue, waiting if necessary
    for space to become available. */
    void put (T obj);
}
 

 Solution:
A blocking queue is essentially a producer-consumer problem. 
We need to use Java wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods. 
This post is particularly useful:

wait( ) tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other 
thread enters the same monitor and calls notify( ).
notify( ) wakes up the first thread that called wait( ) on the same object.
notifyAll( ) wakes up all the threads that called wait( ) on the same object. The 
highest priority thread will run first.



Code (Java):

 
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
 
public class BlockingQueue<T> {
    private Queue<T> queue;
    private int capacity = 10;
     
    // Constructor 
    public BlockingQueue(int capacity) {
        queue = new LinkedList<>();
        this.capacity = capacity;
    }
     
    // Add the given element to the end of the queue, 
    // Waiting if necessary for space to become available
    public synchronized void put(T obj) 
            throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.size() == capacity) {
            wait();
        }
         
        queue.add(obj);
        notifyAll();
    }
     
    // Retrive and remove the head of the queue, 
    // waiting if no elements are present
    public synchronized T take() 
            throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.size() == 0) {
            wait();
        }
         
        T obj = queue.poll();
        notifyAll();
         
        return obj;
    }
}
